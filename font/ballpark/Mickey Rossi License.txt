These are the rules!

This font is free, but...

This is a recreation of a font I couldn't find in digital format. Don't put it on a CD or website or resell it in anyway without first contacting me (fontboy@subflux.com). If you want a friend to have it, send them a link to it (www.subflux.com/fonts.htm).

If you designed this font originally and are upset that I have the temerity to give away my version, send me an email, we can work it out (www.subflux.com/fonts.htm).

If you use this font, send me a link or JPG of the font in action, I love to see my babies at work. (fontboy@subflux.com)

Oh, and this font is offered as is, it may missing letters or stuff and if it blows up your machine don't blame me it isn't my fault.

Thanks for fonting,
